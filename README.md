Knowledge graph on Git commit history

Usecase:

Requirements
* Data Extraction: Retrieve commit data from a Git repository


* Knowledge Graph Construction: Organize the extracted data into a graph format that captures relationships between entities such as commits, authors, and files.


* LLM Integration: Incorporate an LLM to enable natural language queries over the knowledge graph, allowing for intuitive exploration and reasoning.

Approaches

* Approach 1:
     *  Leverage LLM to construct a Knowledge Graph
         * As LLM understands and processes Natural Language text better, convert given json to unstructured data and then feed to LLM to create Knowledge graph
     *  Store graph in a in-memory graph store ( NetworkXEntityGraph - LangChain or networkx - python ) and encorporate LLM to query on that data

     Tried this approach - was unable to achieve this, facing some issues when using LLM to query on LLM using Langchain


* Approach 2: [ Graph RAG ]
    *  Leverage LLM to construct a Knowledge Graph
         * As LLM understands and processes Natural Language text better, convert given json to unstructured data and then feed to LLM to create Knowledge graph
     *  Store graph in a graph database like Neo4j  and encorporate LLM to query on that data

    This approach is working fine but felt that the knoweledge graph generated by LLM can be improved by providing the allowed nodes and allowed relationships when knowledge graph is being created using LLM


* Approach 3: [ Knowledge Graph Agent - RAG Based Approach ]
    *  Leverage LLM to construct a Knowledge Graph
         * As LLM understands and processes Natural Language text better, convert given json to unstructured data and then feed to LLM to create Knowledge graph
    *  Store graph in a graph database like Neo4j
    * Create a vector index on descriptive information like commit message, author, committer, filename to answer descriptive question ( Vector similarity on Neo4j graph - Neo4j Vector index )
    * Use Graph Cypher Search provided by Langchain which converts the natural language text to cypher queries aand execute queries on Neo4j to get appropraite response. This is useful for performing complex operations like aggregations, counting and identifying complex relationships
    * Create Knowledge Graph Agent, responsible to deal with both descriptive tasks using vector indexing and aggregation and to identify complex relationships using Graph Cypher Search
 
    Tried Graph Cypher Search, haven't implemented Vector indexing

* Approach 4: [ Knowledge Graph Chain of Thought ]
  * Combines the benefits of both Chain of Though and Knowledge graphs
  * Step by step reasoning model to reason over knowledge graphs and utilizes reasoning path generation method to generate chain of knowledge with high confidence
 
    Haven't tried yet. Seems like this has the potential to solve the Usecase

Conclusion:
* Among all the approaches above, Approach 4 seems to be most probable to solve the usecase as it follows chain of thought prompting, reduced hallucinations, improved reasoning, minimize API calls for LLM.
