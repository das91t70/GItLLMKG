Knowledge graph on Git commit history

Usecase:

Requirements
* Data Extraction: Retrieve commit data from a Git repository


* Knowledge Graph Construction: Organize the extracted data into a graph format that captures relationships between entities such as commits, authors, and files.


* LLM Integration: Incorporate an LLM to enable natural language queries over the knowledge graph, allowing for intuitive exploration and reasoning.

Approaches

* Approach 1:
     *  Leverage LLM to construct a Knowledge Graph
         * As LLM understands and processes Natural Language text better, convert given json to unstructured data and then feed to LLM to create Knowledge graph
     *  Store graph in a in-memory graph store ( NetworkXEntityGraph - LangChain or networkx - python ) and encorporate LLM to query on that data

     Tried this approach - was unable to achieve this, facing some issues when using LLM to query on LLM using Langchain


* Approach 2: [ Graph RAG ]
    *  Leverage LLM to construct a Knowledge Graph
         * As LLM understands and processes Natural Language text better, convert given json to unstructured data and then feed to LLM to create Knowledge graph
     *  Store graph in a graph database like Neo4j ( NetworkXEntityGraph - LangChain or networkx - python ) and encorporate LLM to query on that data

    This approach is working fine but felt that the knoweledge graph generated by LLM can be improved by providing the allowed nodes and allowed relationships when knowledge graph is being created using LLM


* Approach 3:
